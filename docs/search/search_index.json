If you have any question or issue with one of our plugins, feel free to reach out directly to us on Discord or Email . Our plugins always come in 2 packages, a regular version and a pro version. Usually, the difference between both packages is that the pro one contains all the plugin source-code, including native code.

Integration \u00b6 Integrating with the plugin is as simple as registering an event in order to get the information, and call a method to start retrieving the data. This is an asynchronous operation but the plugin ensures that all event handlers are run in the Unity main thread. using ImaginationOverflow.AndroidInstallReferrer ; using ImaginationOverflow.AndroidInstallReferrer.JavaInterop ; .... InstallReferrerManager . Instance . ReferrerInformationCollected += Instance_ReferrerInformationCollected ; InstallReferrerManager . Instance . FetchInformationCollected (); In the event handler you have access to all referral information stored by the play store, or in case of an error, the reason for the error and its details: private void Instance_ReferrerInformationCollected ( InstallReferrerInfo data ) { if ( string . IsNullOrEmpty ( data . Error ) == false ) { Debug . LogErrorFormat ( \"Deferred Deep Link Error!\\n{0}\\nIs Exception: {1}\" , data . Error , data . IsException ); return ; } var referrerInfo = data . InstallReferrer ; var referrerTime = data . ReferrerClickTime ; var installTime = data . InstallTime ; var playInstant = data . GooglePlayInstant ; } Features \u00b6 Caching \u00b6 The plugin, by default, automatically caches the referrer info after the first data collection, this avoids unnecessary calls to the native API, internally we use PlayPrefs to store this information. If this behavior is not intended you can deactivate it by setting CacheReferrerInformation to false before calling the FetchInformationCollected method. // // Deactivate caching // InstallReferrerManager . Instance . CacheReferrerInformation = false ; (...) The plugin reads from the PlayPrefs in the static constructor of the InstallReferrerManager class, that means that you can test if there are any cached data before you register your handler and call the FetchInformationCollected method: if ( InstallReferrerManager . Instance . ReferrerInfo != null ) { //do something } Note When caching is enabled and cached data is available, the plugin won't query the Google Play Install Referrer API , it will automatically trigger the ReferrerInformationCollected event. Note On Unity Editor the caching feature is always disabled , this was made by design to allow continuous testing. Universal Deep Link Integration \u00b6 The plugin also integrates directly with our Universal Deep Link plugin , so if you enable this option the ReferrerInformationCollected event won't ever be called, and instead, the LinkActivated will. To enable the Universal Deep Link integration, you just need to set FetchInformationCollected only argument as true: InstallReferrerManager . Instance . FetchInformationCollected ( triggerUniversalDeepLinkEvent : true ); The generated link passed to the Universal Deep Link plugin will have the following format: androidInstallReferrer://info?InstallReferrer={0}&GooglePlayInstant={1}&InstallTime={2}&ReferrerClickTime={3}&Error={4}&IsException={5} // // {0} - install referrer [URL encoded] // {1} - GooglePlayInstant information // {2} - Install Time [Unix timestamp] // {3} - Referrer Click Time [Unix timestamp] // {4} - Error [URL Encoded] // {5} - Is Exception // To retrieve all arguments you can use the following snippet: private void Instance_LinkActivated ( ImaginationOverflow . UniversalDeepLinking . LinkActivation la ) { if ( la . Uri . StartsWith ( \"androidInstallReferrer\" )) { // // Deferred activation // var installReferrer = WWW . UnEscapeURL ( la . QueryString [ \"InstallReferrer\" ]); var playInstant = bool . Parse ( la . QueryString [ \"GooglePlayInstant\" ]); var installTime = long . Parse ( la . QueryString [ \"InstallTime\" ]). UnixTimestampToDateTime (); var referrerClickTime = long . Parse ( la . QueryString [ \"ReferrerClickTime\" ]). UnixTimestampToDateTime (); var error = WWW . UnEscapeURL ( la . QueryString [ \"Error\" ]); var isException = bool . Parse ( la . QueryString [ \"IsException\" ]); } ... } Note The UnixTimestampToDateTime function, is an extension method of long included with the plugin. To use it don't forget to include the ImaginationOverflow.AndroidInstallReferrer.Helpers namespace. About Referrer Installs \u00b6 Referrer installs work by adding custom information to the Play Store URL, the Play Store app stores this information and relays them to the target app/game after it's opened. The play store URLs have the following template: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=[APP/GAME_ID] To add referral information you need to include on this store URL the referrer argument, this argument should be URL Encoded . https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=[APP/GAME_ID]&referrer=[MY_ARGUMENTS] Although you can add anything that you wish to these arguments, they usually contain Urchin Tracking Module parameters , these are usually used for Google Analytics (and similar services) to track referral information automatically. Considering one of our games, Sudoku Zenkai as an example for referral link usage: Package ID: com.imaginationoverflow.sudokuzenkai Arguments: utm_source=imaginationoverflow.com&utm_medium=docs&puzzle=123 Arguments Encoded: imaginationoverflow.com%26utm_medium%3Ddocs%26puzzle%3D123 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imaginationoverflow.sudokuzenkai&referrer=imaginationoverflow.com%26utm_medium%3Ddocs%26puzzle%3D123 Warning Link generation , Link distribution , and Referral Tracking are out of this plugin scope, the plugin only purpose is to retrieve the information and give it to you, the plugin doesn't handle anything else not stated on this documentation. Testing \u00b6 Editor \u00b6 In the plugin, we included a quick and simple way for you to test the integration right from the Unity Editor. To use it go to Window -> ImaginationOverflow -> Deferred Deep Linking: A Debug window will popup where you can configure the arguments you wish to pass as referrer information: After you complete the integration with the Deferred Deep Linking plugin, simply run your project, and press the Debug button, the ReferrerInformationCollected will be triggered with the configured referrer information. The debug window contains a selectable label that allows you to preview how your links will look like once your app/game is on the store. Device \u00b6 To test the plugin integration while developing you can use the google play store alpha or beta tracks, but if you wish to test without deploying your app to the play store you can test by changing your application package name to any currently available app/game on the Play Store, as an example, lets use one of our games Super Bunny Laser Spikes, which package name com.imaginationoverflow.superbunnylaserspikes Then get your referral link ready: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id =[ TARGET_PACKAGE_NAME ] & referrer =[ YOUR_ARGUMENTS_URL_ENCODED ] URL Decoded arguments: utm_source = imaginationoverflow.com & utm_medium = docs & myrandomargument = 0xdeadbeef Final Link https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id = com.imaginationoverflow.superbunnylaserspikes & referrer = utm_source%3Dimaginationoverflow.com%26utm_medium%3Ddocs%26myrandomargument%3D0xdeadbeef Tip To encode/decode your arguments you can use on Unity the WWW.(EscapeURL/UnEscapeURL) methods, on standard .NET HttpUtility.(UrlEncode/UrlDecode) or this online tool On your device, make sure that the app isn't installed, and open the referral link, the play store should appear and the install button should be visible. Finally, install your app/game via adb or press Build and Run on the Unity Editor: adb install myAwesomeGame.apk You should see the store page Install button changing to Open, press it and you will be able to see the referral information that you passed along on ReferrerInformationCollected event callback.","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"deferreddeeplinking/#integration","text":"Integrating with the plugin is as simple as registering an event in order to get the information, and call a method to start retrieving the data.
